If you're at all involved in the data engineering space, you've probably heard of [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow). Since its [inception as an open-source project at AirBnb in 2015](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/airflow-a-workflow-management-platform-46318b977fd8), Airflow has quickly become the gold standard for data engineering, getting public contributions from folks at major orgs like [Bloomberg](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/airflow-on-kubernetes/), [Lyft](https://eng.lyft.com/running-apache-airflow-at-lyft-6e53bb8fccff), [Robinhood](https://robinhood.engineering/why-robinhood-uses-airflow-aed13a9a90c8), and [many more](https://github.com/apache/airflow#who-uses-apache-airflow).

If you're just getting your feet wet, you're probably wondering what all the hype is about. We're here to walk you through the basic concepts that you need to know to get started with Airflow.

## History

In 2015, Airbnb experienced a problem. They were growing like crazy and had a massive amount of data that was only getting larger. To achieve the vision of becoming a fully data-driven organization, they had to grow their workforce of data engineers, data scientists, and analysts â€” all of whom had to regularly automate processes by writing scheduled batch jobs. To satisfy the need for a robust scheduling tool,  [Maxime Beauchemin](https://soundcloud.com/the-airflow-podcast/the-origins-of-airflow) created and open-sourced Airflow with the idea that it would allow them to quickly author, iterate on, and monitor their batch data pipelines.

Since Maxime's first commit way back then, Airflow has come a long way. The project joined the official Apache Foundation Incubator in April of 2016, where it lived and grew until it graduated as a top-level project on January 8th, 2019. Almost two years later, as of December 2020, Airflow has over 1,400 contributors, 11,230 commits, and 19,800 stars on Github. On December 17th 2020, [Airflow 2.0](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/introducing-airflow-2-0) was released, bringing with it major upgrades and powerful new features. Airflow is used by thousands of Data Engineering teams around the world and continues to be adopted as the community grows stronger.

## Overview

[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/index.html) is a platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. It is completely open source and is especially useful in architecting and orchestrating complex data pipelines. Airflow was originally created to solve the issues that come with long-running cron tasks and hefty scripts, but it's since grown to become one of the most powerful open source data pipeline platforms out there.

Airflow has a couple of key benefits, namely:

- **It's dynamic:** Anything you can do in Python, you can do in Airflow.
- **It's extensible:** Airflow has readily available plugins for interacting with most common external systems. You can also create your own plugins as needed.
- **It's scalable:** Teams use Airflow to run thousands of different tasks per day.

With Airflow, workflows are architected and expressed as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), with each node of the DAG representing a specific task. Airflow is designed with the belief that all data pipelines are best expressed as code, and as such is a code-first platform where you can quickly iterate on workflows. This code-first design philosophy provides a degree of extensibility that other pipeline tools can't match.

## Use Cases

Airflow can be used for virtually any batch data pipelines, and there are a ton of [documented use cases](https://github.com/jghoman/awesome-apache-airflow#best-practices-lessons-learned-and-cool-use-cases) in the community. Because of its extensibility, Airflow is particularly powerful for orchestrating jobs with complex dependencies in multiple external systems.

For example, the diagram below shows a complex use case that can easily be accomplished with Airflow. By writing pipelines in code and using Airflow's many available plugins, you can integrate with any number of different, dependent systems with just a single platform for orchestration and monitoring.

![Example Use Case](https://assets2.astronomer.io/main/guides/intro-to-airflow/example_pipeline.png)

If you're interested in more specific examples, here are a few cool things we've seen folks do with Airflow:

- Aggregate daily sales team updates from Salesforce to send a daily report to executives at the company.
- Use Airflow to organize and kick off machine learning jobs running on external Spark clusters.
- Load website/application analytics data into a data warehouse on an hourly basis.

We further discuss Airflow's use cases in our [podcast episode here](https://soundcloud.com/the-airflow-podcast/use-cases) if you're interested in diving deeper!

## Core Concepts

### DAG

A Directed Acyclic Graph, or DAG, is a data pipeline defined in Python code. Each DAG represents a collection of tasks you want to run and is organized to show relationships between tasks in Airflow's UI. When breaking down the properties of DAGs, their usefulness becomes clear:

- Directed: If multiple tasks with dependencies exist, each must have at least one defined upstream or downstream task.
- Acyclic: Tasks are not allowed to create data that goes on to self-reference. This is to avoid creating infinite loops.
- Graph: All tasks are laid out in a clear structure with processes occurring at clear points with set relationships to other tasks.

For example, the image below shows a valid DAG on the left with a couple of simple dependencies, in contrast to an invalid DAG on the right that is not acyclic.

For a more in-depth review on DAGs, check out our [Intro to DAGs guide](https://astronomer.io/guides/dags).

### Tasks

[Tasks](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html?highlight=hook#tasks) represent each node of a defined DAG. They are visual representations of the work being done at each step of the workflow, with the actual work that they represent being defined by operators.

### Operators

[Operators](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html?highlight=hook#operators) are the building blocks of Airflow, and determine the actual work that gets done. They can be thought of as a wrapper around a single task, or node of a DAG, that defines how that task will be run. DAGs make sure that operators get scheduled and run in a certain order, while operators define the work that must be done at each step of the process.


![Example DAGs](https://assets2.astronomer.io/main/guides/intro-to-airflow/operator.png)

There are three main categories of operators:

- **Action Operators** execute a function, like the [PythonOperator](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/apache-airflow/modules/pythonoperator) or [BashOperator](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/apache-airflow/modules/bashoperator)
- **Transfer Operators** move data from a source to a destination, like the [S3ToRedshiftOperator](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/amazon/modules/s3toredshiftoperator)
- **Sensor Operators** wait for something to happen, like the [ExternalTaskSensor](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/apache-airflow/modules/externaltasksensor)

Operators are defined individually, but they can pass information to other operators using [XComs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html?highlight=hook#xcoms).

At a high level, the combined system of DAGs, operators, and tasks looks like this:

### Hooks

[Hooks](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html?highlight=hook#hooks) are Airflow's way of interfacing with third-party systems. They allow you to connect to external APIs and databases like Hive, S3, GCS, MySQL, Postgres, etc. They act as building blocks for operators. Secure information such as authentication credentials are kept out of hooks - that information is stored via Airflow connections in the encrypted metadata db that lives under your Airflow instance.

### Providers

[Providers](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/index.html) are community-maintained packages that includes all of the core `Operators` and `Hooks` for a given service (e.g. Amazon, Google, Salesforce, etc.).  As part of Airflow 2.0 these packages are delivered multiple, separate but connected packages and can be directly installed to an Airflow environment.

> To browse and search all of the available Providers and modules, visit the [Astronomer Registry](https://registry.astronomer.io), the discovery and distribution hub for Apache Airflow integrations created to aggregate and curate the best bits of the ecosystem.

### Plugins

Airflow plugins represent a combination of Hooks and Operators that can be used to accomplish a certain task, such as [transferring data from Salesforce to Redshift](http://astronomer.io/guides/salesforce-to-redshift). Check out our [open-source library of Airflow plugins](https://github.com/airflow-plugins) if you'd like to check if a plugin you need has already been created by the community.

### Connections

[Connections](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts.html?highlight=hook#connections) are where Airflow stores information that allows you to connect to external systems, such as authentication credentials or API tokens. This is managed directly from the UI and the actual information is encrypted and stored as metadata in Airflow's underlying Postgres or MySQL database.
